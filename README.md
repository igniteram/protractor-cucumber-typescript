###Protractor-Cucumber-TypeScript Setup Guide   
This project demonstrates the basic protractor-cucumber-typescript framework project setup.

###Features
* No typings.json or typings folder, they have been replaced by better **'@types'** modules in package.json
* ts-node(typescript execution environment for node) in cucumberOpts. 
* All scripts written with Typescript2.0
* Neat folder structures with transpiled js files in separate output folder.
* Page Object design pattern implementation
* DirectConnect capability for Chrome & Firefox(works best with 47.0.1) browsers
* Extensive hooks implemented for BeforeFeature, AfterScenarios etc.
* Screenshots on failure feature scenarios


###To Get Started

####Pre-requisites
1.NodeJS installed globally in the system.
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2.Chrome or Firefox(47.0.1 recommended) browsers installed.

3.Text Editor(Optional) installed-->Sublime/Visual Studio Code/Brackets.

####Setup Scripts
* Clone the repository into a folder
* Go inside the folder and run following command from terminal/command prompt
```
   npm install 
```
* All the dependencies from package.json and ambient typings would be installed in node_modules folder.

####Run Scripts
```
    npm test
```
* The above command would create an output folder named 'Typescript' and transpile the .ts files.
* It launches the Firefox Browser and run the scripts

####Writing Features
```
Feature: To search typescript in google
@TypeScriptScenario

  Scenario: Typescript Google Search
    Given I am on google page
    When I type "Typescript"
    Then I click on search button
    Then I clear the search text
```
####Writing Step Definitions
    
```
    import {browser} from 'protractor/globals';
    import {SearchPageObject} from '../Pages/searchPage';
    import * as cucumber from '../node_modules/@types/cucumber';
    let chai = require('chai').use(require('chai-as-promised'));
    let expect = chai.expect;
    
    export  = function() {
        let search: SearchPageObject = new SearchPageObject();
    
        this.Given(/^I am on google page$/, () => {
            return expect(browser.getTitle()).to.eventually.equal('Google');
        });
    }
```

####Writing Page Objects
```
import {$} from 'protractor/globals';
    
export class SearchPageObject {
    public searchTextBox:any;
    public searchButton:any;

    constructor() {
        this.searchTextBox = $("input[name='q']");
        this.searchButton = $("button[name='btnG']");
    }
}
```
####Cucumber Hooks
Following method takes screenshot on failure of each scenario
```
this.After((scenario, done) => {
    if (scenario.isFailed()) {
        return browser.takeScreenshot().then(function (base64png) {
            let decodedImage = new Buffer(base64png, 'base64').toString('binary');
            scenario.attach(decodedImage, 'image/png');
        }, (err) => {
            done(err);
        });
    } else {
        done();
    }
});
```
####CucumberOpts Tags
Following configuration shows to call specific tags from feature files
```
cucumberOpts: {
    compiler: "ts:ts-node/register",
    monochrome: true,
    strict: true,
    plugin: ["pretty"],
    require: ['../StepDefinitions/*.ts', '../Support/*.ts'],
    tags: '@TypeScriptScenario,@CucumberScenario,@ProtractorScenario'
}
```
